# Coinbase Advanced Trade API Credentials
# ========================================
#
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual credentials:
#   cp .env.example .env
#
# Or set these as environment variables directly:
#   export COINBASE_API_KEY='your-key'
#   export COINBASE_API_SECRET='your-secret'
#
# SECURITY NOTES:
# - NEVER commit .env to version control
# - NEVER share your API credentials
# - Use minimal permissions when creating API keys
# - Regularly rotate your API keys
#
# To get API credentials:
# 1. Go to https://www.coinbase.com/settings/api
# 2. Create a new API key with required permissions:
#    - View account balance
#    - Trade
#    - View orders
# 3. Copy the key and secret here

# Your Coinbase API Key
# Format: organizations/YOUR-ORG-ID/apiKeys/YOUR-KEY-ID
COINBASE_API_KEY=organizations/your-organization-id/apiKeys/your-api-key-id

# Your Coinbase API Secret
# If not set here, you will be prompted to enter it when the app starts
# (This is the more secure option - leave this commented out)
# COINBASE_API_SECRET=your-api-secret-here
